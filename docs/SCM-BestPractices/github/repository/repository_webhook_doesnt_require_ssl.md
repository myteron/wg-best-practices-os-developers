# Webhooks Should Be Configured To Use SSL

policy name: repository_webhook_doesnt_require_ssl

severity: LOW

## Description

Webhooks that are not configured with SSL enabled could expose your software to
man in the middle attacks (MITM).

## Threat Example(s)

If SSL verification is disabled, any party with access to the target DNS domain
can masquerade as your designated payload URL, allowing it freely read and
affect the response of any webhook request.
In the case of GitHub Enterprise Server instances, it may be sufficient only to
control the DNS configuration of the network where the instance is deployed, as
an attacker can redirect traffic to the target domain in your internal network
directly to them, and this is often much easier than compromising an
internet-facing domain.

## Remediation

1. Make sure you can manage webhooks for the repository
2. Go to the repository settings page
3. Select "Webhooks"
4. Verify url starts with https
5. Press on the insecure webhook
6. Enable "SSL verification"
7. Click "Update webhook"
